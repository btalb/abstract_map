Abstract Map Python Package
=============================

Package provides a python implementation of the abstract map, wrapped up in a ROS package. The package is intended to be used for the final journal of the human cues project. The package scope is to be a quick complete implementation of the final abstract map that implements seamlessly with the ROS architecture on the GuiaBot. The other existing versions of the abstract map either don't perform well and are extremely outdated (MATLAB implementation), or don't facilitate quick development (c++ implementation).
